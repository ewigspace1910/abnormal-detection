# abnormal-detection
I.Introduce
1.	In this project, we aim to explore the capabilities of various deep-learning frameworks in detecting and classifying network intursion traffic with an eye towards designing a ML-based intrusion detection system.

2.	The dataset includes seven different attack scenarios: Brute-force, Heartbleed, Botnet, DoS, DDoS, Web attacks, and infiltration of the network from inside. The attacking infrastructure includes 50 machines and the victim organization has 5 departments and includes 420 machines and 30 servers. The dataset includes the captures network traffic and system logs of each machine, along with 80 features extracted from the captured traffic using CICFlowMeter-V3. (download  HERE)
